This repository contains the artifacts from the systematic literature review (SLR) on LLM-based software vulnerability detection ("A Systematic Literature Review on Detecting Software Vulnerabilities with Large Language Models"). 
The SLR analyzes 227 studies published between January 2020 and June 2025 and provides a structured taxonomy of detection approaches, input representations, system architectures, adaptation techniques, and dataset usage.

To support reproducibility and structured comparison, we publicly release:
- A curated list of surveyed **papers**, along with their categorization can be found [here](https://github.com/hs-esslingen-it-security/Awesome-LLM4SVD/tree/main/taxonomy). This README will be continuously updated to track the latest papers.
- A list of the most commonly used **datasets**, including download sources
